# 🚦 US Traffic Accidents Analysis (2016–2023)

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the US Accidents (2016–2023) dataset, a large-scale countrywide dataset of traffic accidents across the United States. The goal is to identify patterns and risk factors associated with traffic accidents, such as weather conditions, time of day, and geographic hotspots.

## 📁 Dataset Description
Dataset Source: Kaggle – US Accidents (2016–2023)
Total Records: 7.7 million+ rows
Columns: 46
Format: CSV
Size: ~1.2 GB

Note: Due to the large file size, the raw dataset is not uploaded to this repository. You can download it directly from Kaggle using the link above.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

Analyze accident frequency by hour, day of the week, and month.

Study the impact of weather conditions, visibility, and precipitation on accident severity.

Visualize geographic accident hotspots using an interactive heatmap.

Identify contributing risk factors using charts and correlation analysis.

## 📊 Key Features & Analysis

⏰ Time-Based Patterns: Most accidents occur during rush hours (7–9 AM & 4–7 PM).

🌧 Weather Impact: Rain, fog, and snow are associated with higher accident severity.

📍 Accident Hotspots: Interactive heatmap shows dense clusters near urban areas and highways.

🔁 Feature Extraction: Extracted Hour, DayOfWeek, and Month from timestamps.

🗺 Folium Heatmap: Generated an HTML map showing accident concentrations across the US.

## 🧰 Tools Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium)

Jupyter Notebook for code and visualization

Optional: Power BI / Tableau for dashboarding
